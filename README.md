This is the readme file for the Simple Text Editor or STE.

STE can open, edit and create text files.

To view, edit or create files from the command line use the command line arguments "-o", "-c" "-e".

STE -o filename // Outputs the contents of the file.

STE -e filename // Opens the file so you can edit it.

STE -c filename // Creates a new file with the filename you type in and opens it to edit it.
